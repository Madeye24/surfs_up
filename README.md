# Surfs_up
# Overview:
Analyis of temperature trends in Oahu, Hawaii. Specifically, summary statistics of temperature data were requested for the months of June and December, in order to determine if a prospective surf and ice cream shop business can sustainably operate year-round as opposed to a seasonal business.

# Challenge Deliverables:
-Deliverable 1: Determine the Summary Statistics for June 
-Deliverable 2: Determine the Summary Statistics for December 
-Deliverable 3: A written report for the statistical analysis (README.md)

# Results:

For the month of June:

For the month of December:

Key Differences in Weather: Oahu, Hawaii

* The average recorded temperature in June is about 75 degrees F, 4 degrees higher than the average temp in December.

* The frequency of temperatures recorded in June tends to have a much more normal, tight bell curve distribution, cooroborated by the smaller std measure of June temps vs December temps

# Summary Findings:

The December temperatures seem to be more variable than those in June given its larger range in recorded temperatures (comparing the max vs min temp of each month)
I would say that even though temperatures recorded in December seem to vary more than those of June, December would still provide appropriate weather conditions for both surfing and demand in ice cream. The average temperatures in June and December only differ by 4 degrees .

Before making a final deicision though, I would want to perform some additional queries to get more color on weather conditions in these two months.

* Firstly , I would like to delve into the summary statistics of temperatures recorded by station for each month. This can help determine geopgraphically where in Oahu to build the prospective shop. By comparing the variances in temperatures and the frequencies recorded, we can narrow in on an optimal location.
* Secondly , I would like to review other important variables that are correlated with optimal beach and surfing weather.
Variables like:
-precipitation, wave swells and wind condition. 
Though there may be some contrasting optimal conditions based on surfing vs sunbathing, it is important to identify those conditions and see how they correlate to foot traffic to the beach (depending on the time of year). It would be ignorant to only value "temperatures" as the key indicator for opening a business.
